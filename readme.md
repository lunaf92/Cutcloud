Cutcloud is born as a Final year project for my Foundation Degree, as a mean to improve my skills in web programming and system design, and it has revealed to be a good system to use for the business I'm using it in at the moment. 
it consist in 4 main parts: 
<ul>
    <li>the home page, where the admin can update all the users through posts</li>
    <li>the rota, that can be written as a draft, visible only to the admins, or public, for all users</li>
    <li>the SOPs and menu descriptions, where files containing those info are uploaded</li>
    <li>and a user administration page, where user can change email or password, and admin can also edit, add or destroy users</li>
</ul>
